				<div class="about-me content">
					<p>Hi there!</p>
					<p>
						My name is Mattia Girellini and I’m from Italy. I am currently
						studying in high school, but i love playing volleyball with my
						friends and teammates.
					</p>
					<p>
						As you can guess, I spend a lot of my free time playing volleyball,
						but I also love programming and have already made some cool
						projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						I’ve been fascinated by technology for a long time, and only in the
						last couple of years have I begun to code. Nonetheless, I have
						already made a couple projects that I am rather proud of.

				<h3>My Portfolio</h3>
				<hr />
				<div class="about-me content">
					<p>
						These are some of my favorite projects, either because they are
						useful, or because they made me learn how to code and mark a path in
						my journey and for this reason have a special place in my heart.
					</p>

					<!-- Tic Tac Toe AI -->
					<div class="project">
						<h4>Tic Tac Toe AI</h4>
						<hr align="left"/>
						<p>
							This is a project that I made to learn how to code. It is a
							website that I made using HTML and CSS.
						</p>
						<p>
							This was my first ever python project (and first project in
							general!), and it made me learn a lot about python but also how
							programming works, concepts that make the foundation for every
							programming language. Concepts that made the learning of other
							languages 10x easier.
						</p>
						<p>
							But speaking of the project itself, it is a TicTacToe artificial
							intelligence (as you probably guessed already), which contains 3
							difficulties:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Easy - the AI chooses randomly. Rather impossible to lose</li>
							<li>
								Medium - the AI isn’t too smart but will try its best to win
								anyways
							</li>
							<li>
								Impossible - the AI is impossible to beat. You will be able to
								tie, but no way you will win
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<!-- Wikipedia Randomizer -->
					<div class="project">
						<h4>Wikipedia Randomizer</h4>
						<hr align="left"/>
						<p>
							This is probably the easiest project in this list, but for me it
							marks the moment i begun using APIs, and it changed everything:
							the possibility to interact with thousands of services such as
							Wikipedia, Spotify, Youtube, Google Docs, and the list goes on.
						</p>
						<p>
							But getting to the juice, the project itself is really easy: you
							insert a language and an optional input, and the program will
							search the optional input on wikipedia (or take a random article
							if no input was given) and from there the program gets a random
							link from that wikipedia article and repeats.
						</p>
						<p>
							The thing that fascinates me about this is that in the sequence of
							random articles you see articles that are correlated, but the
							correlation goes away quickly.<br />
							For example, an example run starting with Roosevelt leads to Bully
							pulpit, Conservative coalition, Justified (season 5) and so on.
						</p>
					</div>

					<!-- Offline Reddit -->
					<div class="project">
						<h4>Offline Reddit</h4>
						<hr align="left"/>
						<p>
							This is the first project where i used some frontend (html, css,
							javascript), and it both marked a new beginning for my programming
							journey as i learned new languages, but it also came from a
							necessity: in the period i made this, i had to be in a flight, and
							didn’t want to give up those 2 hours of fly time to reading,
							sleeping or anything like that: i wanted to browse reddit, but of
							course there was no internet connection.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, I made this, which takes some posts and it’s comments while
							you have internet access, and saves them in a file. Then, when you
							need it, you can easily load them in a UI that is very similar to
							Reddit’s.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even though i still spent the whole flight sleeping, I am still
							proud of my project.

							This is one of my latest projects, and with different styles, how
							can I not like it?
