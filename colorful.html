				<div class="content">
					Hi there!<br />
					My name is Mattia Girellini and I’m from Italy. I am currently
					studying in high school, but i love playing volleyball with my friends
					and teammates.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					As you can guess, I spend a lot of my free time playing volleyball,
					but I also love programming and have already made some cool projects.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					I’ve been fascinated by technology for a long time, and only in the
					last couple of years have I begun to code. Nonetheless, I have already
					made a couple projects that I am rather proud of.

				<div class="header">My Portfolio</div>

				<div class="content">
					These are some of my favorite projects, either because they are
					useful, or because they made me learn how to code and mark a path in
					my journey and for this reason have a special place in my heart.
				</div>

				<div class="project">
					<div class="project-header">TicTacToe Ai</div>
					<div class="project-content">
						<p>
							This was my first ever python project (and first project in
							general!), and it made me learn a lot about python but also how
							programming works, concepts that make the foundation for every
							programming language. Concepts that made the learning of other
							languages 10x easier.
						</p>

						<p>
							But speaking of the project itself, it is a TicTacToe artificial
							intelligence (as you probably guessed already), which contains 3
							difficulties:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Easy - the AI chooses randomly. Rather impossible to lose</li>
							<li>
								Medium - the AI isn’t too smart but will try its best to win
								anyways
							</li>
							<li>
								Impossible - the AI is impossible to beat. You will be able to
								tie, but no way you will win
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="project">
					<div class="project-header">Wikipedia Randomizer</div>
					<div class="project-content">
						<p>
							This is probably the easiest project in this list, but for me it
							marks the moment i begun using APIs, and it changed everything:
							the possibility to interact with thousands of services such as
							Wikipedia, Spotify, Youtube, Google Docs, and the list goes on.
						</p>
						<p>
							But getting to the juice, the project itself is really easy: you
							insert a language and an optional input, and the program will
							search the optional input on wikipedia (or take a random article
							if no input was given) and from there the program gets a random
							link from that wikipedia article and repeats.
						</p>
						<p>
							The thing that fascinates me about this is that in the sequence of
							random articles you see articles that are correlated, but the
							correlation goes away quickly. For example, an example run
							starting with Roosevelt leads to Bully pulpit, Conservative
							coalition, Justified (season 5) and so on.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="project">
					<div class="project-header">Spotify Downloader</div>
					<div class="project-content">
						<p>
							This is by far my favorite python project. I took inspiration for
							the idea from a Youtube Video, but the programming is all mine and
							I am very proud of this
						</p>

						<p>
							As the name suggest, you give the program a Spotify playlist URL,
							and it will download the song and put the .mp3 file in a
							folder.<br />
							It does this by searching the song on Youtube and dounloading from
							there, as a direct download from spotify is not allowed.<br />
							Due to this, the result might not be the exact song, but to solve
							this i applied filters (such as author and length) to get an
							accurate results.
						</p>

						<p>
							Currently the only problem i’m facing is with some very specific
							remixes, that either return the original song or another remix,
							but i’m working on it.
						</p>

				<div class="project">
					<div class="project-header">Offline Reddit</div>
					<div class="project-content">
						<p>
							This is the first project where i used some frontend (html, css,
							javascript), and it both marked a new beginning for my programming
							journey as i learned new languages, but it also came from a
							necessity: in the period i made this, i had to be in a flight, and
							didn’t want to give up those 2 hours of fly time to reading,
							sleeping or anything like that: i wanted to browse reddit, but of
                            course there was no internet connection.
						</p>

						<p>
							So, I made this, which takes some posts and it’s comments while
							you have internet access, and saves them in a file.<br />
							Then, when you need it, you can easily load them in a UI that is
                            very similar to Reddit’s.
						</p>

						<p>
							Even though i still spent the whole flight sleeping, I am still
							proud of my project.
